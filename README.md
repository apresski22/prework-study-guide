# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The project was intended to teach the student the basics of front-end web development and how to write the corresponding code in a local environment, and push it to a repository (in this case, GitHub), where other developers can work and collaborate on the same project.

In addition, the project helped the student learn how to set up the environment on their computer (Git and VSCode), as well as how to create a GitHub account and navigate around GitHub.

The project solves the problem of different features of an application that could be worked on simultaneously by other contributors of the repository, by keeping the code in an isolated environment until it is reviewed and ready to be merged with the main part (or branch) of the repository.

We learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals - just enough to create a functional webpage. We also learned how VSCode and Git work together.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
